# Configuration Bundles Manager (B.M.N)
It is something like a package manager (but weirder) focused in shell script automation packages, created to facilitate the post-installation of Linux based operational systems. Especially package management across different distributions.

# Setup instructions
Install syntax:

``sudo bash bmn.sh -s repository``  
- The repository field can be from github raw content or any other downloadable source.  
- You can insert the repository in the "repo" file and you won't need to specify this field.
