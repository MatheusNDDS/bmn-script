# CFGB Script
It is something like a package manager created to facilitate the post-installation of Linux systems.

# Setup instructions
Syntax:

``sudo sh cfgb.sh -s repository``  
- The repository field can be from github raw content or any other downloadable source.  
- You can insert the repository in the "repo" file and you won't need to specify this field.
