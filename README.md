# Automation Bundles Manager (BMN)
It is something like a package manager (but weirder) focused in shell script automation packages, created to facilitate tasks in Linux based operational systems. Especially package management across different distributions.

# Setup instructions
Install syntax:

``sudo bash bmn.sh -s “repository”``  
- The repository field can be from github raw content or any other downloadable source.  
- You can insert the repository in the "repo" file and you won't need to specify this field.

# Usage instructions
Syntax: ``sudo bmn ”command” “arguments” ``  
For help: ``bmn --help``
